# Runtimes libraries family

---
The Runtimes Libraries Family is a collection of NuGet packages designed to enable asset loading at runtime. In **Evergine**, the Content folder is used to store static assets required by your project. However, there are cases where assets need to be loaded dynamically from an external source or the internet. This is the primary goal of the Runtimes libraries: to provide the ability to dynamically load assets at runtime, offering greater flexibility when developing your projects with Evergine.

These libraries include various helpers, components, behaviors, and managers that simplify the asset loading process. Additionally, they are designed to be lightweight and cross-platform, allowing you to use them across all Evergine-supported platforms seamlessly.
