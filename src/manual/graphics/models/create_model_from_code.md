# How to Create a Model from Code

![Create **Model** Header](images/CustomModel.jpg)

Models we use in our projects are usually pregenerated by 3D graphics software _(like 3ds Max or Blender)_. However, some projects will demand that we create our own models (and meshes as well). 
This article exemplifies the creation of a new model by code.

# Single mesh model

>[!NOTE]
> The creation of custom meshes (With their vertex and index information) is covered in [this article](../meshes/index.md#Create-Mesh-from-Code).

For a single mesh Model, **Evergine** offers an easy way creating it, just passing it as a parameter in its constructor:

```csharp
public Model(string name, Mesh mesh)
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **name**  | Name of the new model. |
| **mesh**  | Mesh used for the new model. |

As a result a new **Model** will be generated with only one node, containing the mesh passed as parameter.

## Sample Code:

```csharp
var assetsService = Application.Current.Container.Resolve<AssetsService>();

// We can create a mesh 
Mesh mesh = this.CreateMesh(this.graphicsContext);

// We simply pass the mesh as constructor parameter with the name.
Model model = new Model("CustomModel", mesh);

// We convert to  an entity as a normal model.
Entity entity = model.InstantiateModelHierarchy("MyModel", assetsService);
this.Managers.EntityManager.Add(entity);

```

# Model with multiple meshes
However, if we want to create more complex models (With multiple meshes, textures, nodes, etc.) we have to manually create the **Model** instance.
In this case, we just use the base **Model** constructor and creates the hierarchy from zero.

## Sample Code
The next code will create a model with two meshes within the same node. These meshes are the one created in the **[Meshes manual page](../meshes/index.md)**

```csharp
// Create two meshes (covered in Meshes article).
var mesh1 = this.CreateMesh1();
var mesh2 = this.CreateMesh2();

// Create MeshContainer, that 
var meshContainer = new MeshContainer()
{
    Name = "MultiplesMeshes",
    Meshes = new List<Mesh>() { mesh1, mesh2 }
};

// Create RootNode, containing the previously defindes mesh container. It also has no children
var rootNode = new NodeContent()
{
    Name = "MultiplesMeshes",
    Mesh = meshContainer,
    Children = new NodeContent[0],
    ChildIndices = new int[0],
};

// Create material. 
// In the Material section of this manual, you can find additional information on this topic.
var material = new StandardMaterial(assetsService.Load<Effect>(DefaultResourcesIDsStandardEffectID))
{
    VertexColorEnabled = true,  // Because the sample mesh uses color by vertex.
    IBLEnabled = false,         // It also doesn't have normal information, so any
    LightingEnabled = false,    // lighting calculations won't work.
};

// Create material List
var materialCollection = new List<(string, System.Guid)>()
{
    ("Default", material.Id), // We assign material's id as the default material.
};

// Finally we define the model with the nodes, material list, mesh containers and the indices of 
// the root nodes (in this case only one).
var model = new Model()
{
    MeshContainers = new[] { meshContainer },
    Materials = materialCollection,
    AllNodes = new[] { rootNode },
    RootNodes = new[] { 0 },
}; 

// We convert to  an entity as a normal model.
Entity entity = model.InstantiateModelHierarchy("MyModel", assetsService);
this.Managers.EntityManager.Add(entity);
