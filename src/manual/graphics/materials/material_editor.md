![Material Editor Interface](images/MaterialEditor.jpg)

The **Material Editor** allows editing of material assets. Double-clicking on a material asset shown in [Assets Details](../../evergine_studio/interface.md) will open this editor. The editor is composed of three main parts:

## **Viewport**

The viewport shows the result of the current material configuration. It has a toolbox on the top side that allows you to change the primitive shown or change the background color. The primitive displayed in the viewport is lit by two lights (front and back) that you can move using the mouse.

| Actions | Description |
|---------| ----------- |
| Left mouse button | Rotate the camera around the primitive. |
| Right mouse button | Rotate the two lights around the primitive. |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom the camera in/out. |

## **Effect**

The properties of the material are defined by the effect used. So, first, to edit or configure your material, you need to select the effect that you want to use. The _Standard effect_ is the default effect used when you create a new material.

## **Properties**

The properties panel displays all the effect properties or the [Material decorator](material_decorators.md) properties associated with the effect. You can configure your materials to change their properties, and the result will be shown in the Viewport.
