## Evergine Launcher

After the installer closes, the Evergine Launcher opens.

The **Evergine Launcher** is a standalone Windows app that allows you to install Evergine versions, create and manage your Evergine projects, and find useful resources like samples, access to learning materials, and support for the Evergine section.
