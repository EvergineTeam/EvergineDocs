The **Evergine** animation system is designed to facilitate complex animations within 3D environments. It can import from 3D models all the animation tracks they contain and play them using different kind of blending and parameters. 

The main aspect of our 3d model animation system are:
- The **Animation3D** component, which lays a full range of different kind of animation clips, allowing the basic controls (**Play**, **Stop**, **Pause**, etc.) and other advanced function like playing specific animation blend tree, a specific time window, and more options.
- The **Animation Clip** as the foundation of how the objects in the scene are animated.
- The **Animation Blend Tree** for offering advanced behaviors like phase adjusted blending, additive animations, etc.
