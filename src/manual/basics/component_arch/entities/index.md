**Entities** are the fundamental objects in Evergine that represent characters, lights, models, and more. An Entity without any Component has no functionality (nothing will be rendered or interacted with).

To give an Entity the properties it needs to become a Light, a Model, or a Camera, you need to add **Components** to it, depending on the type of objects you want to create.

## Basic Properties
Despite entities having no functionality themselves, they provide several ways to identify Entity instances and access information:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ID** | `Guid` | The **unique identifier** of an Entity. Among other objects in Evergine, entities are identified by their ID property. There can only be one Entity with the same ID. <br/> This value is usually autogenerated when a new Entity is created or when it is deserialized when a Scene is loaded from an asset. |
| **Name** | `String` | The name of the Entity. Several objects can share the same name. |
| **Tag** |  `String` | A string **used to categorize** entities. It is useful to tag entities with common characteristics (for instance, tag all vehicle entities with the tag `"Vehicle"`). Evergine provides ways to get [entity collections](entity_manager.md) sharing the same Tag. |
| **Components** | `IEnumerable<Component>` | A collection of registered components in this Entity. |
| **Scene** | `Scene` | Points to the Scene in which this Entity has been registered. This value is set after attaching the Entity (see the [LifeCycle](../../lifecycle_elements.md) document for further details). |
