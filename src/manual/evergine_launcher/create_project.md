The project configuration window will open. Here, you can choose the _Project Name_, the disk location of your project, and the Evergine version to use. Additionally, you can choose a single or multiple profiles for your project.

> [!Tip]
> New profiles can be added later.

As the number of templates has grown in the latest Evergine releases, we have decided to add some filters that may be useful for finding the desired template. You have a free text input and a platform dropdown selector that you can combine to limit template results.
