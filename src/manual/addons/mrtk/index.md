**Evergineâ€™s Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)** provides a comprehensive set of components and tools designed to simplify the development of Mixed Reality applications. This open-source project is actively maintained and can be found in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/EvergineTeam/MixedRealityToolkit).

This library provides a set of basic building blocks for Evergine development on XR platforms such as

- Meta Quest devices.
- OpenVR headsets (HTC Vive / Oculus Rift)
- PICO headsets.

It is heavily based on Microsoft's [Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unity](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity).
