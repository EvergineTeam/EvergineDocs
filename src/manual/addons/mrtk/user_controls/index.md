# User controls

The MRTK includes a set of prebuilt user controls, designed from our experience in XR projects to support essential UI layouts and data display in mixed reality applications. Below is a summary of the available controls:

- [Scroll View](scrollview.md): A scrollable container for navigating larger content sections within limited space. Supports vertical scrolling.

- [List View](listview.md): A structured, interactive list format ideal for displaying collections of items with information such as names, descriptions, or images.

- [ComboBox](combobox.md): A dropdown list for selecting from multiple options, configurable for various layout needs. This control allows intuitive data selection without cluttering the UI.

- [CheckBox](checkbox.md): A binary selection control that provides visual feedback for checked and unchecked states, useful for quick toggles or setting options.

Each control has its own dedicated page with further details on setup, customization, and integration into your MRTK project.
