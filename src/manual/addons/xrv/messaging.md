# Messaging

_XRV_ includes a simple implementation of the publisher-subscriber pattern, enabling you to communicate between two separate parts of code using messages. You can use it in components, services, or any other elements as needed. You can emit any type of message through this channel; however, it is recommended to create specific message types that can contain any information you consider useful.

To emit a message, just create a custom message class and use the _Publish_ method.

```csharp
public class MyMessage 
{
    public MyMessage(string data1, int data2) 
    {
        this.Data1 = data1;
        this.Data2 = data2;
    }

    public string Data1 { get; private set; }

    public int Data2 { get; private set; }
}

var pubSub = this.xrvService.Services.Messaging;
var message = new MyMessage("my-data", 1234);
pubSub.Publish(message);
```
\
To receive messages of a given type, you should use the _Subscribe_ method. It returns a subscription token, which you must save to be able to unsubscribe, depending on how your code behaves. For example, if you want to use it in a _Component_, the most common pattern will be to subscribe in _OnAttach/OnActivated_ and unsubscribe in _OnDetach/OnDeactivated_.

```csharp
public class MyComponent : Component 
{
    [BindService]
    private XrvService xrvService = null;

    private PubSub pubSub => this.xrvService.Services.Messaging;
    private Guid subscription;

    protected override bool OnAttached()
    {
        bool attached = base.OnAttached();
        if (attached)
        {
            this.subscription = this.pubSub.Subscribe<MyMessage>(this.OnMyMessageReceived);
        }

        return attached;
    }

    protected override void OnDetach()
    {
        base.OnDetach();
        this.pubSub.Unsubscribe(this.subscription);
    }

    private void OnMyMessageReceived(MyMessage message) 
    {
        // Do something
    }
}
```
