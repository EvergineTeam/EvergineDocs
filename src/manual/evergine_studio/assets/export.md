# Exporting Assets

![Assets](images/assets.jpg)

**Evergine** usually doesn't load resource files (`.jpg`, `.fbx`, etc.) directly at runtime. Instead, it processes these files and compiles or exports them into binary files that can be properly and efficiently loaded into **Evergine**.

For example, the exported **Model** asset file contains data that can be directly copied into buffers and uploaded onto the graphics card.

> [!NOTE]
> **Evergine** actually _can_ load direct resource files at runtime. However, it relies on third-party libraries that would make the asset workflow much slower and more memory-consuming. Also, you wouldn't be able to edit their properties.
> However, for many applications, that's not only a good option but a desirable one. Especially if it needs to load images dynamically from the internet, for example.

## Exported Asset File Extensions

Every asset type defines the exported file asset extension (in the same way it defines its metafile file extension). Below you can find them:

| Asset Type              | Exported Extension |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | 
| Texture                 | `.weptx`           |
| Model                   | `.wepmd`           |
| Sound                   | `.wepsn`           |
| Scene                   | `.wepsc`           |
| Effect                  | `.wepfx`           |
| Sampler                 | `.wepsp`           |
| Material                | `.wepmt`           |
| Render Layer            | `.weprl`           |
| Post Processing Graph   | `.weppp`           |

## Export Process

The **Evergine** asset export process is actually a pipeline with the following steps:

1. Gather information about the **resource file** (if any).
2. Get the **application profile** name.
3. Check if the asset **metafile** contains specific parameters for the **app profile**:
   * If there is a specific **profile definition**, use those parameters.
   * Otherwise, the asset will use its **default profile** parameters.
4. Convey all the parameters of the asset and **generate** the exported binary file.
