Evergine Studio's interface uses dockable panels to organize different sections, allowing you to create your own layout with the panel locations that you prefer. The above image shows the default layout, and its main panels are:

* **Project Explorer**: Used to manage the [assets](assets/index.md) and [packages](../addons/index.md) of the current project.
* **Assets Details**: Shows the assets of the current folder selected in the Project Explorer. Allows you to open, rename, or create new assets.
* **Asset Editor**: Used to edit assets (scenes, materials, textures, etc.). Some asset types, such as scenes, have dedicated editors where you can edit them. To open a dedicated editor (when available), double-click the asset in the **Asset Details** region.

## Asset Editors
