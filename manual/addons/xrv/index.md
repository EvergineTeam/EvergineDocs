# Extended Reality Viewer (XRV)

---

XRV is a library that we are using internally while developing custom XR experiences for our customers. It tries to gather in a single place different functionalities and features commonly required by applications we build, like floating windows, hand menu, voice commands, etc.

It is based on our own [MRTK add-on](../mrtk/index.md), so it uses the same input pointers, user controls like buttons or sliders, configuration components, etc. Based on that we have built all XRV infrastructure.

Most of the features are supported for many platforms, but some of them are not for some of those platforms. You can run XRV for devices like:
- Meta Quest 2
- Meta Quest Pro
- Microsoft HoloLens 2
