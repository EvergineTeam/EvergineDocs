Evergine provides **real-time physics simulation** including collision, gravity and other forces. Using built-in physics engine helps with creating realistic behavior for your scene entities. This section explains how physics work, how to add them to your scene, and how to control them in your custom components.

## Built-in physic engine

Evergine uses the open-source **[Bullet Physics](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/)** engine. For detailed information, see the [Bullet User](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/docs/Bullet_User_Manual.pdf)

> [!NOTE]
> Evergine provides an abstraction API that allows you to provide your custom physic integration.
