Evergine provides **real-time physics simulation**, including collision, gravity, and other forces. Using the built-in physics engine helps create realistic behavior for your scene entities. This section explains how physics work, how to add them to your scene, and how to control them in your custom components.

## Built-in Physics Engine

Evergine uses the open-source **[Bullet Physics](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/)** engine. For detailed information, see the [Bullet User Manual](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/docs/Bullet_User_Manual.pdf).

> [!NOTE]
> Evergine provides an abstraction API that allows you to integrate your custom physics solutions.
