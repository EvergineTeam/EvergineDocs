# Extensions
---
**Evergine** core packages come with many useful features, including numerous Services, Managers, and Components in the `Evergine.Framework` and `Evergine.Components` packages.

In addition to this, Evergine offers several Extensions that provide integration and functionality with different technologies or libraries, but are too specific to be part of the main Evergine packages.
