# XR Trackable Items
A **trackable** is something that can be tracked during application execution. This is, and object which changes on its position and orientation can be detected. Then, you can use that information to 
add 3D elements assoiciated to those trackables. While a trackable is detected, its world transform matrix is updated depending on real-world object changes. There are different types of trackables that can be detected by _Evergine_: planes, images and faces. They all extend [XRTrackableItem](xref:Evergine.Framework.XR.TrackableItems.XRTrackableItem) as base class.

## Supported Devices

Currently in Evergine, the following devices has **Trackable Items** support:

| Device | XR Platform |
| --- | --- |
| **Android** | ARCore |

## XRTrackableItem
This base class holds information that is common to any trackable element.

### Properties and Methods

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ID** | Gets trackable identifier. This is internally generated by _Evergine_ and will be unique for all detected trackables. |
| **Transform**  |  Stores position and orientation information for the detected trackable. Will be continuously updated while application is running with real-world object information.  |

## XRPlaneTrackable
This class represents plane detection. Depending on XR platform implementation you can use  [XRPlaneDetectionType](xref:Evergine.Framework.XR.TrackableItems.Planes.XRPlaneDetectionType) to detect just vertical or horizontal planes, or even enable both types of plane detection.

### Properties and Methods
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **BoundaryPolygon** | Holds information of vertices for an approximation of polygon boundaries for a detected plane. Values are relative to XZ plane that should be transformed by trackable transform information to get boundaries in world-relative coordinates. |
| **Size** | Estimated width and length of the plane. |
| **Type** | Type of detected plane: horizontal with upward or downward facing, or vertical plane. |

## XRImageTrackable
Trackable for images, no matter they are static or in movement.

### Properties and Methods
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **DatabaseIndex** | Indicates index of the image in the internal images database. |
| **Name** | Indicates name of the image in the internal images database. |
| **Size** | Size of detected image. |
| **TrackingMethod** | Depending on tracking state: if image is not being tracked, is tracked by last pose information or full tracking.|

## XRFaceTrackable
This class is used to face tracking. A single face at the same time would be detected.

### Properties and Methods
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **MeshVerticesPointer** | Pointer to native face mesh vertices buffer. |
| **MeshVerticesCount** | Number of face mesh vertices. |
| **MeshTextureCoordinatesPointer** | Pointer to native face texture coordinates buffer. |
| **MeshTextureCoordinatesCount** | Number of texture coordinates. |
| **MeshNormalsPointer** | Pointer to native face mesh normals buffer. |
| **MeshNormalsCount** | Number of normals. |
| **MeshTriangleIndicesPointer** | Pointer to native mesh index buffer. |
| **MeshTriangleIndicesCount** | Number indexes. |
| **LeftForeheadPose** | Pose for the left forehead. |
| **RightForeheadPose** | Pose for the right forehead. |
| **NosePose** | Pose for the nose. |
