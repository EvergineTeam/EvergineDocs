Evergine comes with several XR platform integrations.

## OpenXR

**OpenXR** is an open royalty-free API standard from Khronos, designed to unify the development across multiple VR/MR/AR (XR) devices.

Behind this initiative, there are companies like Meta, Microsoft, HTC, Steam, Varjo, and Magic Leap, allowing support to all their devices.
