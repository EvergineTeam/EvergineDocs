Evergine includes several XR platform integrations.

## OpenXR

**OpenXR** is an open, royalty-free API standard from Khronos, designed to unify development across multiple VR/MR/AR (XR) devices.

This initiative is backed by companies like Meta, Microsoft, HTC, Steam, Varjo, and Magic Leap, enabling support for all their devices.
