Scenes are a 3D space where you can create your experiences/projects. The evergine scene is composed of entities and each entity will be a element of your scene. Scenes are a type of [asset](index.md) and have a dedicated Editor [**Scene Editor**]().

You can find the scene assets in the [**Assets Details**](../interface.md) panel when you select a folder in the [**Project Explorer**](../interface.md).
