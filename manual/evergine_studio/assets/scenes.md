# Scenes

![Scenes](images/scenes.jpg)

Scenes are a 3D space where you can create your experiences/projects. An Evergine scene is composed of entities, with each entity being an element of your scene. Scenes are a type of [asset](index.md) and have a dedicated Editor, the [**Scene Editor**]().

You can find the scene assets in the [**Assets Details**](../interface.md) panel when you select a folder in the [**Project Explorer**](../interface.md).

The scene file has the **_wscene_** extension and always comes with a **_wesc_** descriptor file and a folder with the same name as the scene.
