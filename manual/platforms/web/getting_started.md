# Getting started with a Evergine web application

---

## Create a new application

From the Evergine launcher you can create a Web (WebGL2.0) project, or add the web profile from the Evergine Studio.

This template adds two projects to the web solution, the _Web_ one which is the web application client, that uses typescript to execute Evergine into a web canvas, and an optional _Server_ project that it is just an Asp server application that implements some optimiziations for asset loading that can only be done from server side.

After editing your scene from Evergine Studio as usual, run the _Web.server_ project or the _Web_ project from Visual Studio 2022 to see it running on the browser.
