# Getting Started with an Evergine Web Application

---

## Create a New Application

From the Evergine launcher, you can create a Web (WebGL 2.0) project or add the web profile from the Evergine Studio.

This template adds two projects to the web solution: the _Web_ project, which is the web application client that uses TypeScript to execute Evergine in a web canvas, and an optional _Server_ project, which is an ASP server application that implements some optimizations for asset loading that can only be done from the server side.

After editing your scene in Evergine Studio as usual, run the _Web.Server_ project or the _Web_ project from Visual Studio 2022 to see it running in the browser.
