# Compute Tasks
---

**Compute Tasks** are GPU programs that don't use the classical GPU pipeline, such as vertex transformations, fragment shading, or geometry programs. They are fully configurable code that can run on a GPU asynchronously. They can be used for massively parallel computational algorithms or to accelerate parts of application rendering. 

Compute tasks need to be associated with a Compute Effect.

The following sections show how to create and use compute tasks in your projects.
