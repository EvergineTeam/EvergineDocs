# DirectX 12

![Microsoft DirectX12 API](images/directx12.jpg)

**DirectX 12** is the latest **Microsoft** graphics API available on all devices running Windows 10/11. **Microsoft** announced this version at GDC on March 20, 2014, and it was officially launched alongside Windows 10 on July 29, 2015. On October 2, 2018, DirectX Raytracing support was added to the API. It quickly became popular, and currently, all the latest GPUs from Nvidia and AMD come with Raytracing support. This is also supported on the **Evergine** low-level API, so **DirectX 12** supports **Evergine's** raytracing API.

## Supported DirectX 12 devices

* Windows 10/11 x64/x86 desktop
* Windows 10/11 ARM64/x86 tablet
