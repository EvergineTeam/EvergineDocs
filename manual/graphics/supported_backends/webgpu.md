**WebGPU** is a working project to become in a future web standard API for accelerated graphics and compute, aiming to provide modern 3D graphics and computation capabilities on Web platform.

It is developed by the **W3C** for the Web community group with engineers from **Apple**, **Mozilla**, **Microsoft**, **Google** and others. This technology run on top of the latest graphics APIs like DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal.

**Evergine** uses **WebGPU** on Web platforms when it is available. Chrome, Edge and Firefox already support it as experimental feature so you need to move to beta channel and active it.
