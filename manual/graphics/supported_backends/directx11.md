**DirectX 11** is one of the most popular graphics APIs, developed by **Microsoft** and supported on all computers using the Windows OS. **Microsoft** announced DirectX 11 at the Gamefest 2008 event in Seattle, and since then, three updates have been released:

* DirectX 11.1 was included in Windows 8.
* DirectX 11.2 was included in Windows 8.1.
* DirectX 11.3 was released in 2015 and was included in Windows 10.

Currently, it is the most popular graphics API on the Windows platform and is supported on all devices running Windows 10. This is the default graphics API used by **Evergine Studio** as well.

## Supported DirectX 11 devices

* Windows 8/10/11 x64/x86 desktop
* Windows 10/11 ARM64/x86 tablet
* HoloLens 2 ARM64

## Checking DirectX 11 version

The DxDiag tool reports detailed information about the DirectX components and drivers installed on your Windows system and is available on Windows 7/8/10/11. To get the latest DirectX version on your system, use Windows Update, as not all versions of Windows can run the latest version of DirectX 11.

```

## Build & Run
