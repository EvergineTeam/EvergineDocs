## Supported formats:
**Evergine** supports the following font file formats:


| Extension |  Description | 
| ----| ----| 
| `.ttf`| <div><p>**TrueType** is an outline font standard developed by Apple in the late 1980s as a competitor to Adobe's Type 1 fonts used in PostScript. It has become the most common format for fonts on the classic Mac OS, macOS, and Microsoft Windows operating systems.</p> <p>The primary strength of TrueType was originally that it offered font developers a high degree of control over precisely how their fonts are displayed, right down to particular pixels, at various font sizes. With widely varying rendering technologies in use today, pixel-level control is no longer certain in a TrueType font. </p></div>|
| `.otf` | <div><p>**OpenType** is a format for scalable computer fonts. It was built on its predecessor TrueType, retaining TrueType's basic structure and adding many intricate data structures for prescribing typographic behavior. OpenType is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation.</p><p>The specification germinated at Microsoft, with Adobe Systems also contributing by the time of the public announcement in 1996.</p><p>Because of wide availability and typographic flexibility, including provisions for handling the diverse behaviors of all the world's writing systems, OpenType fonts are used commonly on major computer platforms.</p>
