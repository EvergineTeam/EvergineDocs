# Sharpen

The **Sharpen** effect is a technique for increasing the apparent sharpness of an image. It is recommended to use this effect in combination with effects that may cause blurring in the image output, such as [Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)](temporal_anti_aliasing.md) or [Fidelity Super Resolution (FSR)](fidelity_super_resolution.md).
