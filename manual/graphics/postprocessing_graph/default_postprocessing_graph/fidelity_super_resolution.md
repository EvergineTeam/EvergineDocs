More details [here](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software-fidelityfx-super-resolution).

This effect allows scale low-resolution image to the final resolution image improving the performance of your render. FSR support 4 recommended configurations:

| FSR 1.0 quality mode | Description | Scale Factor | Input Resolution | Output Resolution | 
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| **Ultra quality**    | Ultra quality mode produces an image with quality virtually indistinguishable from native rendering. It should be selected when the highest quality is desired.| 1.3x | 1477x831 <br> 1970x1108 <br> 2646x1108 <br> 2954x1662 | 1920x1080 <br> 2560x1440 <br> 3440x1440 <br> 3840x2160 |
| **Quality**          | Quality mode produces a super resolution image with quality representative of native rendering, with a sizeable performance gain. | 1.5x | 1280x720 <br> 1706x960 <br> 2293x960 <br> 2560x1440 | 1920x1080 <br> 2560x1440 <br> 3440x1440 <br> 3840x2160 |
| **Balanced**         | Balanced mode produces a super resolution image approximating native rendering quality, with a major performance gain compared to native. | 1.7x | 1129x635 <br> 1506x847 <br> 2024x847 <br> 2259x1270 | 1920x1080 <br> 2560x1440 <br> 3440x1440 <br> 3840x2160 |
| **Performance**      | Performance mode visibly impacts image quality and should only be selected in situations where needing additional performance is critial. | 2.0x   | 960x540 <br> 1280x720 <br> 1720x720 <br> 1920x1080 | 1920x1080 <br> 2560x1440 <br> 3440x1440 <br> 3840x2160 |
