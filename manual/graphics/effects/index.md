An **effect** is a _uber-shader_ so be able to represent a single shader or a large group of shaders. A shader is a piece of code written in a specific language creates to run on a GPU. The effects in evergine are written using [**HLSL**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-pguide). The effects automatically translate to another language when it is necessary.

## Default Effect
