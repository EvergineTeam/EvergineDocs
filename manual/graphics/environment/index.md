In this section, we will cover how you can control the environmental light in Evergine.

## Image Based Lighting (IBL)

**Image Based Lighting (IBL)** is a rendering technique that involves capturing an omnidirectional representation of real-world light information as an image, typically using a 360Â° camera. This image is then projected onto a dome or sphere, similar to environment mapping, and is used to simulate the lighting for objects in the scene. This allows highly detailed real-world lighting to be used to light a scene instead of trying to accurately model illumination using an existing rendering technique.

Image-based lighting often uses **high-dynamic-range** (HDR) imaging for greater realism.

IBL involves the creation of two lighting components:
- **Irradiance map** (Diffuse): For the diffuse illumination, we need what is called an Irradiance Map. This usually involves a cubemap (or Spherical Harmonics) that stores the amount of light coming from each direction.
- **Radiance map** (Specular): For specular illumination, we need a texture called **Pre-filtered Mip-Mapped Radiance Environment Map (PMREM)**. This is another cubemap that pre-calculates the reflected environment. Additionally, it stores different reflections for various roughness values in its MipMap levels. ![radiance](images/ibl_prefilter_map.png) [*Credits LearnOpenGL*](https://learnopengl.com/PBR/IBL/Specular-IBL)

Evergine will use Image Based Lighting to create environmental illumination.
