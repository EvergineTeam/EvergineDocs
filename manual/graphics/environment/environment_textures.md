# Environment Textures

This is the best way to transfer the illumination of a equirectangular HDR image to your scene.

## Equirectangular textures

A equirectangular image is created to convert a 360ยบ view into a 2D texture. It usually has an aspect ratio of 2:1. 

If you use HDR equirectangular images (generally `.hdr` format) will produce more realistic illuminations. In [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/hdris) site you can find a lot of environment textures grouped by categories (outdoor, skies, indoor, night, etc...)

## SkyboxEffect

En Evergine, to create an environment lighting from a equirectangular image, you need to create a environment sphere dome with a SkyboxEffect material, that will use the HDR environment texture.

The SkyboxEffect only has 3 useful properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Texture** | The equirectangular image to use as environment. |
| **TextureSampler** | The SamplerState used to sample the texture. |
| **Parameters_Intensity** | A factor that modify the intensity of the texture. This is used to increase or reduce the brightness of the texture. |

| [!WARNING]
| If you want to use this effect with a common SphereMesh, use the **Skybox** layer in the LayerDescription property.

## Using Skybox material

Steps to create an Environmental lighting using a equirectangular image:

1. Import into your Evergine project an equirectangular HDR image.
2. Create a new SkyboxEffect material
3. Edit the new SkyboxEffect material, and set the Texture property with the imported equirectangular image.
4. Assign the Skybox LayerDescription tho the new SkyboxEffect material.
5. Now you have two options:
    - **Option A (reuse the SkyAtmosphere):** 
      - Select the SkyAtmosphere entity, in the MaterialComponent, set the new SkyboxEffect material. This will override the AtmosphereController appearance.
    - **Option B (create a new sky dome):**
      1. Create a new Sphere primitive in your scene, and assign the new SkyboxEffect material. 
      2. In the new entity, set the Tag property to "Skybox"
      3. Delete the SkyAtmosphere entity.
