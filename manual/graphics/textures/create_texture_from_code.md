# Create a Texture from Code

The most common use of **Texture** is assigning them to **Materials** and **Components**. However, it's perfectly valid to use and even create a **Texture** from code.

## Load a Texture Asset from Code
As explained in [this article](../../evergine_studio/assets/use.md), this is perfectly possible. Here is a sample code for creating a primitive entity with a Diffuse material.

```csharp
protected override void CreateScene()
{
    AssetSceneManager assets = this.Managers.AssetSceneManager;

    // Loading 'Diffuse.png' located in 'Content/Textures/'
    Texture diffuseTexture = assets.Load<Texture>(EvergineContent.Textures.Diffuse**png);

    // We create a standard material and assign the texture as a diffuse channel.
    StandardMaterial materialDecorator = new StandardMaterial(assets.Load<Effect>(EvergineContent.Effects.StandardEffect));
    material.BaseColorTexture = diffuseTexture;

    // We create a primitive
    Entity teapot = new Entity("texturedTeapot")
                        .AddComponent(new Transform3D())
                        .AddComponent(new TeapotMesh())
                        .AddComponent(new MaterialComponent() { Material = materialDecorator.Material })
                        .AddComponent(new MeshRenderer());

    this.Managers.EntityManager.Add(teapot);
}
```

## Create a Texture from Code
Creating a **Texture** demands a little bit more effort and is defined in [this article](../low_level_api/texture.md). Basically, we need to define two main things:
- **TextureDescription** structure
- **DataBoxes** with the texture data

#### TextureDescription

The **TextureDescription** struct contains all the specifications of the **Texture** so the graphics card can properly load the **buffer data** accordingly and be able to extract all the information.

| Property | Values | Description |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| TextureType | Texture2D, Texture2DArray, Texture1D, Texture1DArray, TextureCube, TextureCubeArray, Texture3D | The type of the texture. |
| Width | unsigned integer | Width of the texture (first dimension). The maximum value is defined by the device hardware. |
| Height | unsigned integer | Height of the texture (second dimension). The maximum value is defined by the device hardware. |
| Depth | unsigned integer | Depth of the texture (third dimension). Used in **Texture3D**. The maximum value is defined by the device hardware. |
| ArraySize | unsigned integer | The number of textures in a **Texture Array** (either 1D, 2D, or Cube). |
| Faces | unsigned integer | The number of texture faces used in **TextureCube** and **TextureCubeArray**. |
| MipLevels | unsigned integer | Maximum number of mipmap levels in the **Texture**. |
| ResourceUsage | <ul><li>**Default**: Requires read and write access from the GPU.</li><li>**Immutable**: Can only be read by the GPU. Cannot be written or accessed by the CPU.</li><li>**Dynamic**: Can be accessed by the GPU (read only) and the CPU (write only). Used for textures updated by the CPU.</li><li>**Staging**: Supports data transfer (copy) from the GPU to the CPU.</li></ul> | Type of access of the **Texture**. |
| Usage | None, Count2, Count4, Count8, Count16, Count32 | Number of samples in the **Texture**. |

#### DataBoxes
A **DataBox** represents a data buffer that contains all pixels of an element of a texture. Every mipmap level, array slice, or cube face defines its own DataBox.
