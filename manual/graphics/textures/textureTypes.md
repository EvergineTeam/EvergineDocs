# Texture Types

![Textures](Images/textures.jpg)

Modern graphic APIs like **DirectX12** or **Vulkan** support a wide range of **texture types** because there are many ways that a **texture** can be accessed and presented. **Evergine** supports all of them. However, some of them are only loaded using specific image formats (like `.dds` or `.ktx`).

## Texture 2D

The classic **two-dimensional** texture. It has **width** and **height**, and as a graphic resource, it can be accessed using two texture coordinates **UV**. 

Almost every image file can be imported as a **Texture2D** asset because it is the most common one.

#### Usage
They are used for almost everything, like sprites, diffuse channels, and normal mapping.

## Texture 2D Array

The same as the **Texture2D** above, but it contains an array of textures.

Modern graphics APIs support **texture arrays**, which are arrays of textures with the same size and format. They are treated as the same _graphic resource_, can have **mipmapping** information, and can be sampled using an extra texture coordinate that indicates which array item needs to be sampled. 

#### Usage
They are useful, for example, for creating sprite atlases or animations, with each element of the array containing a frame of the animation or atlas. 

## Texture 1D

A texture that contains only one dimension (**width**) and is sampled using only one texture coordinate.

#### Usage
Useful when dealing with one-dimensional information like **gradients**, for example.

## Texture 1D Array

An array of one-dimensional textures as specified before. It's sampled using two texture coordinates: one for the texture address and another for the element in the array.

#### Usage
Using multiple gradients for a custom shader.

## Texture Cube

Commonly known as a **Cubemap**, it's a texture that contains 6 individual 2D textures, each forming one side of a cube. It has the useful property that it can be sampled using a direction vector instead of texture coordinates.

It's like having a 1x1x1 cube and a vector with the sampling direction at its center. It will return the texel placed at the intersection point. Like in the following diagram.

#### Usage
**TextureCubes** are mainly used as environment textures for IBL, like radiance and irradiance texture cubes for specular or diffuse components, or creating **Skyboxes** for the background environment of your scene.

## Texture Cube Array

**Texture Cube Arrays** take a step further than the normal cubemap and store an array of texture cubes, so they need an additional coordinate to retrieve the element of the array.

#### Usage
**TextureCubeArrays** are an interesting choice when creating **Reflection Probes** of your scene. In one resource, you can store all the probes of the scene.

## Texture 3D

A **3D Texture** is an image that contains information in three dimensions rather than the standard two.

#### Usage
They are commonly used to simulate volumetric effects such as fog, smoke, raymarching operations, or for sprite animation blending.
