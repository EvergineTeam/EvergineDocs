**Evergine** supports complex particle system simulations, taking advantage of **Compute Shaders** whenever possible.

## Basics
Particles are elements that are used in large numbers to create a wide range of visual effects like sparks, clouds, fire, etc. **Evergine** has a *Particle System* asset that developers can create, adjust, and reuse in their scenes.

## GPU vs CPU
**Evergine** supports **GPU particles** simulation when the platform is supported. These simulations are based on *compute shaders*, allowing a fast and efficient representation of a large number of particles compared to the classical **CPU particles**.
