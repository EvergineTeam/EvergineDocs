# Particle System Properties

![Particles properties](images/particles-properties.png)

A particle system has the following properties.

## Particles Material
Group that manages the properties related to the particle material.

|  Property      | Default value | Description   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| **Texture**  | _particle.png_            | The texture that will appear in each particle quad. |
| **Sampler State**  | _LinearClampSampler_            | The texture sampler state. |
| **RenderLayer**  | _Additive_            | The texture render layer. |

## General properties
Properties that control the basic aspects of the particle system.

|  Property      | Default value | Description   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| **Max Particles**  | _1000_ | The maximum number of particles the emitter can handle. The emission will be paused if it reaches this number. |
| **Gravity**  | _0_ | <div><p>Sets the gravity of the particle system.</p><li>Gravity value of 9.8</li><video autoplay loop muted width="480"><source src="images/gravity.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div>
| **Drag**  | _0_ | <div><p>The amount of resistance the particle will encounter.</p><li>Drag value of 0.</li><video autoplay loop muted width="480"><source src="images/drag_off.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><li>Drag value of 2.</li><video autoplay loop muted width="480"><source src="images/drag_on.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div> |
| **Simulation Space**  | _World_ | <div><p>Sets the simulation space of the particle. In **Local** space, the particle positions stay relative to its emitter transform. In **World** space, all coordinates are global.</p><li>Simulation Space value of World.</li><video autoplay loop muted width="480"><source src="images/world_space.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><li>Simulation Space value of Local.</li><video autoplay loop muted width="480"><source src="images/local_space.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div> |
| **Random Precision**  | _Medium_ | The precision of the random values generated, both in _GPU_ and _CPU_ simulations. **High** precision will randomize better but with a performance cost; **Low** precision will improve performance but produce less random values. **Medium** precision (_default value_) offers a good balance. |

### Life
The life configuration panel controls the particle's remaining lifetime when it's emitted.

| Property | Default value | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Init Life mode | _Constant_ | Sets whether the lifetime of the particle is **Constant** (_Init Life_) or **RandomBetweenTwoConstants** (a random value between _Init Life_ and _Init Life2_). |
| Init Life | _5_ | The initial life of the particle. |
| Init Life 2 | _5_ | The second value of the initial life range.

The following video shows how different life parameters behave:

### Speed
The initial speed configuration panel controls the particle speed magnitude (in space units per second) when it's emitted. The initial **Velocity** of the particle will be the initial direction vector multiplied by the **Speed** of the particle.

| Property | Default value | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Init Speed mode | _Constant_ | Sets whether the initial speed is **Constant** (_Init Speed_) or **RandomBetweenTwoConstants** (a random value between _Init Speed_ and _Init Speed 2_). |

| Property | Default value | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|

### Angular Speed
The angular speed configuration panel controls the particle rotation speed when it's emitted. The quad will spin facing the camera with this angular speed.

| Property | Default value | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Init Angular Speed mode | _Constant_ | Sets whether the initial angular speed is **Constant** (_Init Angular Speed_) or **RandomBetweenTwoConstants** (a random value between _Init Angular Speed_ and _Init Angular Speed 2_). |
| Init Angular Speed | _0_ | The initial angular speed of the particle. |

|  Property      | Default value | Description   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| **Shape type**  | _Point_ | <p>_Enum_ that contains all the shape emitter types. Currently, the options are:</p><li>Point</li><li>Sphere</li><li>Box</li><li>Circle</li><li>Entity</li><li>Edge</li>|

More information about these shapes here: [Particle Shapes](particle_shapes.md).

## Spawn 
The *Spawn* property defines when and how many particles are emitted.

| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| **Spawn type**  | _Rate_ | <p>_Enum_ that contains all the spawn emitter types. Currently, the options are:</p><li>Rate</li><li>Burst</li><li>Distance</li> |

## Color Over Life
These properties manage how the particle color changes over its life.
In a future **Evergine** version, we will implement a proper _Gradient Color_ editor, but in the meantime, we've defined the color over the life of the particle using the following properties according to this diagram:

![Color Over Life Diagram](images/color_over_life.png)

> [!Note]
> The color of the gradient is applied as a tint over the initial color of the particle.

| Property | Default value | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Color Animated | _false_ | Sets whether the particle color is animated throughout its lifetime. |
| Color Over Life 1 | _Transparent_ | Color of the **first** point of the animation. |

## Size Over Life
These properties control how the particles change their size over their lifetime.
In a future **Evergine** version, we will implement a proper _Curve Editor_, but in the meantime, we've defined the size over life of the particle using the following properties according to this diagram:

![Size Over Life Diagram](images/size_over_life.png)

> [!Note]
> The size of the curve is applied as a multiplier over the initial size of the particle.

## Noise
The noise panel allows the application of a turbulence field into the particle system. All the properties of this panel are used to control the parameters of that field.

| Property | Default value | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Noise Enabled  | _false_ | Sets whether the particle system is affected by the noise field. |
| Noise Strength | _1_ | How much the particles are affected by the noise field. A larger value will generate more chaos! |
| Noise Size | _1_ | The scale of the noise field. Large values cause more wavy noise; small values will change the behavior among close particles. |
| Noise Frequency | _1_ | Represents the period at which the noise data is sampled. |
| Noise Speed | _(1, 1, 1)_ | The velocity vector at which the noise field is moving. |

The following video shows a particle system affected by noise _(Strength 1, Size 10, Frequency 1, Speed (0, -1, 0))_.

This panel allows the particle system to be affected by forces and to tune which ones can affect them.

The different available forces are explained in [this article](particle_forces.md).
