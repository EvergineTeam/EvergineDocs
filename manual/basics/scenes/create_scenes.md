# Create Scenes

When you create a project, it contains an initial **Scene** (`MyScene.wescene`) that includes some base entities.

In **Evergine** scenes are created similarly to other assets.

## Create a Scene Using Evergine Studio

There are two ways to create a **Scene** in **Evergine Studio**:

- In the **Assets Details** panel, right-click and select the **Create scene** menu item.

- Alternatively, in the main menu, select **Assets > Create scene**.

>[!NOTE]
> When you create a **Scene**, the new asset will be placed in the currently selected Asset Folder, which is shown in the **Project Explorer** panel and the **Assets Details** panel.

## Create a Scene by Code

To generate a new **Scene** using code, simply create a new class that extends the **Scene** class:

1. Create a new class in your **Evergine** project (e.g., `MyScene.cs`).
2. Make that class inherit from the **Scene** class.
3. You can override the following important methods:

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **CreateScene()** | Method where all the scene entities are created and added to the **Scene**.
| **RegisterManagers()** | Method where the **SceneManagers** are loaded. `base.RegisterManagers()` will register the default **SceneManagers**. 
| **Start()** | Called just before the **Scene** starts updating and drawing.
| **End()** | Ends the **Scene**.
| **Pause()** | Called when the **Scene** is paused. This can occur if the app is suspended or if it is manually paused through the **ScreenContextManager**.
| **Resume()** | Resumes the **Scene** when it is paused.

Here is a code example:
````csharp

public class MyScene : Scene
{
    public override void RegisterManagers()
    {
        base.RegisterManagers();
        this.Managers.AddManager(new Evergine.Bullet.BulletPhysicManager3D());        	
    }

    protected override void CreateScene()
    {
        // Add scene entities.

        // Create a camera
        var cameraEntity = new Entity("camera")
            .AddComponent(new Transform3D())
            .AddComponent(new Camera3D())
            .AddComponent(new FreeCamera3D());

        this.Managers.EntityManager.Add(cameraEntity);
    }
}
