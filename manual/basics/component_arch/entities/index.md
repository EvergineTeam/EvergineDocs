**Entities** are the fundamental objects in Evergine that represent characters, lights, models and so on. 
An Entity without any Component has no functionality (nothing will be rendered or interacted).

To give an Entity the properties it needs to become a Light, a Model, or a Camera, you need to add **Components** to it. Depending on what kind of objects do you want to create.

## Basic Properties
Despite entities has no functionality itself, it provides several ways to identify Entity instances and access to information:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | ---|
| **ID** | `Guid` | The **unique identifier** of an Entity. Among other objects in Evergine, entities are identified by its ID property. There can only be one Entity with the same ID. <br/>This value is usually autogenerated when a new Entity is created, or when it is deserialized when a Scene is loaded from asset. |
| **Name** | `String` | The name of the Entity. Several objects can share the same name. |
| **Tag** |  `String` | A string **used to categorize** entities. It is useful to tag entities with things in common (for instance, tag all vehicle entities with the tag `"Vehicle"`). Evergine provides ways to get [entity collections](entity_manager.md) sharing the same Tag. |
| **Components** | `IEnumerable<Component>` | A collection of registered components in this Entity |
| **Scene** | `Scene` | Point to the Scene in which this Entity has been registered. This value is set after attaching the Entity (see [LifeCycle](../../lifecycle_elements.md) document for further details)|
