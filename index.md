# WELCOME

The idea behind **Wave Engine** is to develop applications/games natively on a Windows, Mac OS X or Linux machine, and easily run those across every supported mobile device. 

For example, a game can be entirely developed on a Windows PC and, in the end, may be deployed on iOS. 

**Wave Visual Editor** handles such logic, automatically generating the required scaffolding to share a common code base, resources set, etc.

## [Manual](manual/index.md)
