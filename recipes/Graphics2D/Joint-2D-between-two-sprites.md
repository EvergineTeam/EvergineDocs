## Goal

A joint in physics is a relationship between two different objects. Such is a base behaviour when working with physics, and [Wave Engine](http://waveengine.net) supports multiple types of 2D joints.

This recipe will briefly summarise all of the available 2D joints, showing how are handled in code in general aspects. We will see how a distance joint results in game.

## Hands-on

Every 2D joint inherits from abstract class [WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.Joint2D](xref:WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.Joint2D`2). Wave Engine supplies currently the following implementations: 
 - [DistanceJoint2D](xref:WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.DistanceJoint2D): the distance between joined entity and original one is kept during the sceneâ€™s life.
 - [WeldJoint2D](xref:WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.WeldJoint2D): rigid relationship between two entities.
 - [MouseJoint2D](xref:WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.MouseJoint2D): establishes a joint between the original entity and the mouse/finger being dragged along the screen (i.e. the entity follows the dragging).
 - [PrismaticJoint2D](xref:WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.PrismaticJoint2D): limits the movement between entities along the specified axis (i.e. in the same way an slider works).
 - [RevoluteJoint2D](xref:WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.RevoluteJoint2D): creates a dependency between two entities where the distance is fixed and each one of them can rotate along the respective anchors.
 - [RopeJoint2D](xref:WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.RopeJoint2D): it is a RevoluteJoint2D specifically designed for ropes.

### With Wave Visual Editor

For example, we will use the [BasicPhysic2D Sample](https://github.com/WaveEngine/Samples/tree/master/Physics2D/BasicPhysic2D) from the Samples repository, that uses all joints

In the scene where we have many entities, select one of the chains:

In the `Entity Details` panel you can see all properties a DistanceJoint2D can have and the other entity which is connected in the ConnectedEntityPath property.


As you can see, adding a joint allows to select the joint type and the connected entity from the scene.

### With Visual Studio (for Windows or Mac)

The code to recreate a similar entity with a distance join by code looks like:

```c#
Entity chain = new Entity("chain")
    .AddComponent(new Transform2D())
    .AddComponent(new Sprite())
    .AddComponent(new SpriteRenderer())
    .AddComponent(new RigidBody2D())
    .AddComponent(new RectangleCollider2D())
    .AddComponent(new DistanceJoint2D(){);
```

## Wrap-up

This recipe has showed us which are the available [Joint2D](xref:WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.Joint2D`2) in Wave Engine, how those are generically used and, more specifically, how the [DistanceJoint2D](xref:WaveEngine.Framework.Physics2D.DistanceJoint2D) works on one of our samples.
Feel free to explore the full [BasicPhysic2D Sample](https://github.com/WaveEngine/Samples/tree/master/Physics2D/BasicPhysic2D) to see the other joints in action.
