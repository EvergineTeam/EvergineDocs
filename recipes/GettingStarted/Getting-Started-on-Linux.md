# Prerequisites

## IDE

You need to install [MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com/) 7.0 or higher to develop with Wave Engine.
Most Linux distributions include an earlier version of MonoDevelop, so you need to install it from the Mono official package repository.

### Installing MonoDevelop

Follow the instructions given in the official Mono page: [Install Mono Develop on Linux](http://www.monodevelop.com/download/#fndtn-download-lin)

### Launching MonoDevelop

To open MonoDevelop, please execute the following command on a console:

    $ monodevelop

It is recommended to create a shotcut anywhere on the desktop to access it more easily. Please refer to your corresponding Window Manager to gather how it is done.
